- **Filtering** - Allows user to view only specific/desired records in the component.
- **Sorting** - Both member and value sorting are supported. It’s allows user to order fields and values (column) either in ascending or descending order respectively.
- **Field List & Grouping Bar** - Supports UI interaction at runtime to dynamically change the report along with sorting, filtering and remove options.
- **Aggregation** - Provides built in aggregation types like sum, average, min, max and count.
- **Calculated Field** - Users can add new value field(s) to the report dynamically using this option.
- **Adaptive Rendering** - Adapts with optimal user interfaces for mobile and desktop form-factors, thus helping the user’s application to scale elegantly across all the form-factors without any additional effort.
- **Exporting** - Provides the option to exporting records to Excel, CSV and PDF formats.
